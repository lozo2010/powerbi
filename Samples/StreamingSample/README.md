Example of creating a streaming dataset and writing to it


# Device codes
In order to use this, follow the instructions in [readme](../../README.md) to create a device code configuration file
for this example.

Then run the example passing in the configuration file. It will create a new StreamingDataset called 'StreamingDataset' 
that gets written to every 5 seconds.
